## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I wanted to create a web application that would allow users to track gardening progress, plan their garden, and keep track of plant information. Users will be allowed to create accounts to save garden layouts, preferences, gather information about companion planting, succession planting, and other gardening techniques and systems. 

Users will also be able to search a plant database by certain criteria, add plants and such to their garden, and get gardening tips etc.

### Features

User accounts - users will be able to save preferences and app will be persistent.

Sorting by preferences - users will be able to list plants by specific preferences (such as zone, isOrganic, or waterNeeds)

Plant info - users will have the ability to look up plant information using an API call

### Technologies

The Backend of the application will be using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, mySQL. The frontend of the application will be using Angular, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. I will also be experimenting with bootstrap.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn more about how to do API calls in java, and learn more about angular and bootstrap.
